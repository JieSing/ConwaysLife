# ConwaysLife
Conway's life built with Forth 


Known-pattern-cell-maps folder contains pregenerated cell maps that can be used in the Conway's life simulation. To generate customised cell map, check "write_up_array" and "Make_array_file" in Conways_life_mechanics.txt.

This folder should include:
-Glider
-Toad
-Gosper_gun
-Gosper_gun_with_eater
-Light_spaceship
-Pentadecathlon

Ensure that these text files of pregenerated cell maps are moved to the same directory as 'Conways_life_mechanics.txt' before 'known_pattern' is called.

Method:
1. In 'Conways_life_mechanics.txt', under the word "read_textfile", change the name of text file to the desired file's name.

2. run word "Known_pattern". Array will now be written into current_array.
